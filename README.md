# quickstart-drupal
## Drupal on the AWS Cloud

This Quick Start deploys a highly available Drupal architecture on the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Cloud.

[Drupal](https://www.drupal.org/) is an open-source, content management platform written in the PHP server-side scripting language, and provides a backend framework for many enterprise websites and applications. Its tools help you build versatile, structured content for dynamic web experiences.

Deploying Drupal on AWS makes it easy to use AWS services to further enhance the performance and extend functionality of your content management framework. This Quick Start lets you choose between [Drupal-7](https://www.drupal.org/drupal-7.0) and [Drupal-8](https://www.drupal.org/8).

The deployment uses Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2), Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC), Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS), and Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS).

The AWS CloudFormation templates included with the Quick Start automate the following:

- Deploying Drupal into a new virtual private cloud (VPC) on AWS
- Deploying Drupal into an existing VPC on AWS

You can also use the AWS CloudFormation templates as a starting point for your own implementation.
